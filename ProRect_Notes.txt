## ProRec Notes

### Attention
1. The 'stop' button does not save the recording.
2. It is highly recommended to prepare several ProRec codes for separate parts of sentences, as recordings will be saved only after all sessions are finished.
3. `speaker.lst` records the speaker's information.
4. The button in the center during the recording session allows the controller to record the same sentences again if the speaker's voice is unclear.
5. The repeating function will signal the speaker by changing the background color.

### Helpful Notes
- Set the channel default to 1/2 to avoid recording voices from both inside and outside the cabin.

### Recommended Process
1. **Recording Requirements**:
   - **Stress**: Emphasize the first noun phrase in a neutral tone.
   - **Speed**: Provide the speaker with several templates to listen to.

2. **Pilot Recording**:
   - Conduct a few recordings to perform a simple pilot test and assess the recording quality.

3. **File Management**:
   - If there are many files to record, split them into multiple PRC files. 
   - This ensures that each part can be saved separately, preventing the loss of all recordings at once.
